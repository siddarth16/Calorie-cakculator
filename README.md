## üìä Calculation Methodology

### BMR Formula (Mifflin-St Jeor)
- **Male**: BMR = (10 √ó weight in kg) + (6.25 √ó height in cm) - (5 √ó age in years) + 5
- **Female**: BMR = (10 √ó weight in kg) + (6.25 √ó height in cm) - (5 √ó age in years) - 161
- **Other**: Average of male and female calculations

### Activity Level Multipliers
- **Sedentary**: √ó 1.2 (Little or no exercise, desk job)
- **Lightly Active**: √ó 1.375 (Light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week)
- **Moderately Active**: √ó 1.55 (Moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week)
- **Very Active**: √ó 1.725 (Hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week)
- **Extra Active**: √ó 1.9 (Very hard exercise, physical job or training twice a day)

### Weight Goal Adjustments
- **Weight Loss**: 15-35% calorie deficit
- **Weight Maintenance**: No adjustment
- **Weight Gain**: 10-30% calorie surplus

## üé® Customization

### Styling
The app uses Tailwind CSS with a custom design system. Key customization points:

- **Colors**: Defined in `tailwind.config.js` under the `theme.extend.colors` section
- **Typography**: Uses Inter font family with custom font weights
- **Components**: Reusable component classes in `src/index.css`

### Configuration
- **Activity Levels**: Modify `ACTIVITY_LEVELS` in `src/utils/calculations.ts`
- **Validation Rules**: Update `validateUserData` function for custom validation
- **PDF Template**: Customize PDF generation in `src/utils/pdfGenerator.ts`
